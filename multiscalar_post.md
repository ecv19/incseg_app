When comparing successive multiscalar profiles, if there is a clear gradient in a single direction,
then segregation is increasaing or decreasing. If the distance between curves is larger on the left,
then segregation is changing fastest at small scales; if the distance between curves is larger on
the right, then segregation is changing fastest at large scales.
