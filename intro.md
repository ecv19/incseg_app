#### Exploring Income Segregation

The goal of this app is to use modern tools to help address the decades old
[call](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article/91/1/39/2235865) that "social scientists should stop
fighting about which measure of segregation was "best" or most "correct," and instead measure all
dimensions simultaneously to see what a multi-dimensional assessment might reveal about the nature
of segregation in U.S. society." In this case, the goal is to see what a multidimensional assessment
says about the ways that residential segregation by income has changed in each metro region of the
United States using the maximum amount of data available:
  
- whether all regions tend to follow similar trends regardless of size or location
- whether trends are consistent across the dimensions of segregation
- whether trends are consistent across all spatial scales or change more slowly/rapidly when considering larger "neighborhood" definitions
- whether trends are consistent for all income groups or whether the richest/poorest groups follow different patterns
  
#### Note

When exploring these data it's important to keep in mind that measuring income segregation using ACS
data is challenging for a few different reasons. First, the data (at the necessary geographic
precision) are sampled over a 5-year period so obtaining a precise segregation estimate is
impossible. Second,
[Census income categories](https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs5/groups/B19001.html) are not
evenly-spaced or particularly highly-detailed, so potential for reaggregation into larger categories
is limited. Third, because of both inflation and mobility in the household income distribution,
choosing a set of fixed breaks to categorize income groups means that the technical meaning of the
categories shifts over time.
