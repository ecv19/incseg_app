[Multiscalar segregation profiles](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1353%2Fdem.0.0019) are a
method for understanding how segregation varies by spatial scale. They plot the value of a
segregation statistic on the y-axis, against the distance threshold that defines the neighborhood on the
x-axis. In general, if the slope is steep, then the region is characterized by mostly small-scale segregation;
if the slope is flat, then the region is characterized by large-scale segregation.
