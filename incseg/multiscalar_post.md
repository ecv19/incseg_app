When comparing successive multiscalar profiles, if there is an obvious color gradient in a single direction,
then segregation is increasing or decreasing. If the distance between curves is larger on the left,
then segregation is changing fastest at small scales; if the distance between curves is larger on
the right, then segregation is changing fastest at large scales. In some places, change happens in opposite directions at different scales. For example in Chicago or Jacksonville, FL, the entropy profile for high-income households is flattening by decreasing at small scales and increasing at larger scales
