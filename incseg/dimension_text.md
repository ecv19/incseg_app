Instead of looking at all segregation measures together, or each one individually, a good way to
compare changes is to group indices according to the
[dimension of segregation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2579183) they represent to see whether
trends diverge. Use the dropdown in the sidebar to change income groups.

- **Evenness** indices measure how much the composition of each neighborhood diverges from the composition of the region. 
- **Concentration** indices measure the "relative amount of physical space occupied by a minority group in the urban environment. Groups that occupy a small share of the total area in a city are said to be residentially concentrated".
- **Exposure** indices measure "the degree of potential contact, or the possibility of interaction, between minority and majority group members within geographic areas of a city"

For these data, it is common for the evenness and exposure dimensions to move in opposite
directions. In large metros, a common pattern is increasing high-income isolation, despite falling
evenness indices, a pattern driven partly by mobility and partly by larger high-income populations.
