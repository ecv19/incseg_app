Instead of looking at all segregation measures together, or each one individually,
a good way to compare changes is to group indices according to the [dimension of segregation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2579183) they represent to see whether trends diverge. 
- **Evenness** indices measure how much the composition of each neighborhood diverges from the composition of the region. 
- **Concentration** indices measure the "relative amount of physical space occupied by a minority group in the urban environment. Groups that occupy a small share of the total area in a city are said to be residentially concentrated".
- **Exposure** indices measure "the degree of potential contact, or the possibility of interaction, between minority and majority group members within geographic areas of a city"
